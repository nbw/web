**Difficulty Level**: Intermediate-ish

If there's one particle that's always stumped me, it's が. They way I've always used it is by memorizing set phrases like:

「 TOPIC 」が　＋　あります。

「 TOPIC 」が　＋　います。

_<p style="text-align:center;">There are just certain times you always use が right?</p>_

You'll only get so far with that way of thinking. Principles over memorization!

It wasn't until I read *[A Students' Guide to Japanese Grammar](https://www.amazon.com/Students-Japanese-Grammar-Hanaoka-McGloin/dp/4469220655)*, by Naomi Hanaoko McGloin, that it really clicked for me. It's one of those books that sat on my shelf for a few years, and blew me away when I finally built up the courage to read it. If you're established in the basics of Japanese grammar and want to dive into some of the deeper nuances then I highly recommend it.

# Particle は

The main function of は is to mark the _topic_ of a sentence. That's _topic_, not _subject_. The difference is super subtle, but McGloin defines a "topic [as] a word or a group of words which indicates what the sentence is about."

A topic that takes は should be either:

1. Established explicitly beforehand.

    + 今日、 男の人<span class="jp">が</span>学校に来ました。皮<span class="jp">は</span>ピザを持って来ました。
    + kyou, otoko no jin <span class="en">ga</span> gakkou ni kimashita. kare <span class="en">ha</span> piza wo mottekimashita.
    + _Today a man came to the school. He brought pizza._

    Here we've established the topic with が.

2. Established by inference; an assummed context

    + 美味しかったけれども、デザートは高いでした。
    + oishikattakeredomo, dezaato wa takaideshita.
    + It was tasty, but dessert was expensive.

    We can infer that the conversation was about a tasty meal, but the topic was dessert.


3. Nouns that are uniquely identifiable (again, inference)

    + カナダ<span class="jp">は</span>意外に大きいです。
    + kanada <span class="en">wa</span> igai ni  ookidesu.
    + _Canada is surprisingly big._

    Canada is an easily reconigizable noun.


4. Pronouns that are identifiable through context (again, inference)

    + それ<span class="jp">は</span>彼の自転車です。
    + sore <span class="en">ha</span> kare no jitennsha desu
    + That is his bike.

    "This" can be conveyed by physically pointing or indicating something.


5. Generic Nouns; nouns that aren't surprising (again, kind of inference)

    + みかんは美味しいだよ。
    + mikan wa oishi dayo
    + oranges are tasty!

    Oranges, well -- they're oranges.

These are the general uses of は, though there are many more like emphasis and/or contrast.

# が instead of を

Not the topic of this post, but worth mentioning.

When using the conditional form of a verb, the particle for the direct object often becomes が.

Some examples:

テニスとします。---> テニスができます。

ビールを飲みます。---> ビールが飲みます。
